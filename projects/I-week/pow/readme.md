# Proof of Work & Mining
## Proof of Work
Proof-of-work is the consensus mechanism that allows decentralized networks like Bitcoin and (previously) Ethereum to come to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions. This prevents users from "double spending" their coins and ensures that everyone is following the rules, making proof-of-work-based networks resistant to attack. The consensus mechanism ends up providing security to a blockchain network just because it demands that everyone follow the consensus rules if they want to participate!

In proof-of-work, mining is the "work" itself.

## Mining
Mining is process of creating a block of transactions to be added to a blockchain.

But how does that tie in to proof-of-work? Well, proof-of-work could just as well be called proof-of-mining!

"Mining" can be considered an industry misnomer. The term gained popularity as it has a close tie in to "miners" digging for

In proof-of-work consensus, nodes in the network continuously attempt to extend the chain with new blocks - these are the miners, nodes that contain mining software. Miners are in charge of extending a blockchain by adding blocks that contain "valid" transactions. In order to add a block, the network will ask miners for their 'proof-of-work'.
